# RISCV_Project
# Architecture 
This RISC-V core has been implemented in accordance with the RISC-V official documentation; we chose to cover the RV32IM ISAs with no Operating System support, i.e., only bare metal programs are supported.
It's a classic five stage pipelined processor that has been tested pre and post synthesis. It can be synthetized both for ASIC and FPGA targets.
