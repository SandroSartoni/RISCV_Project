\section{Multiplication and Division Unit (EX2)}
%Digital arithmetic is nowadays well known and implemented in various applications and products. After technology scaling has become slower, the need of more advance technology in terms of performances, energy consumption and occupied area brought more focus on the development of better architectures. The strength of the major companies in the area of general purpose microprocessors stands also here.\\
The present unit implements multiplication and division operations and takes a less academic approach to the matter. While almost all algorithms are well described in literature, the implementation still is left to hardware designers, which brings issues about especially having different data formats in the same architecture.
\subsection{Specifications}
The unit must execute correctly all the RV32-M instructions, so each operation must be capable to handle both signed and unsigned numbers, or even mixed types.

Official RISC-V Foundation specifications also explicitly ask that in case of :
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consecutive \textit{MULTH[S][U]} and \textit{MULT} 
    \item Consecutive \textit{DIV[U]} and \textit{REM[U]}
\end{itemize}
Where \textit{rs1} and \textit{rs2} sections are equal, the unit must immediately provide the correct result without performing again the same computation.
Lastly \textit{division by zero} and \textit{division overflow} must rise two different exceptions. It's important to notice that the first case is the only arithmetic trap in the standard ISA, for which we are not providing any interaction with the execution environmentâ€™s trap handlers. Anyway division by zero must cause an immediate control flow change and only a single branch instruction can be inserted before every division one, which will be very predictably not taken.

\subsubsection{Algorithms chosen}
After a first research on how modern microprocessors perform multiplications and divisions, the most common solution was found to be a shared microprogrammed architecture based on sequential algorithms: \textit{Booth encoded multiplication} and \textit{Sweeney-Robertson-Tocher division}. A short description of both can be found on the following sections.\\
This is mainly for three motivations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both algorithm can share the same basic hardware blocks. 
    \item Working on sequential architectures opens to several possible improvements on the critical path, avoiding any frequency issue inside machines that tends to achieve shorter and shorter periods. Also low-power techniques can be easily implemented during design time. Since both operations share the same architecture any upgrade done for one may be applicable also for the other.
    \item Algorithms can be modified to elaborate more steps in a single clock cycle with very low timing overhead. Those algorithms are addressed as \textit{higher radix}.
\end{itemize}
The proposed implementation focuses just on the first two points, while was chosen to keep the simple radix-2 algorithms because higher ones would lead to longer design time. But once an eventual high-radix algorithm is set up for the specific case, few modifications on the radix-2 architecture may be needed.
\subsubsection{The use of carry save adder}
The kernel of the recipes for multiplication and division is made of additions and shifts repeated for a certain amount of cycles. The first improvement suggested by sources on computer arithmetic was to use a carry save adder and store the result of each iteration in the sum-carry form.\\
Partial reminder and partial product will be taken as just said. Then final result has to be computed by a "normal" sum, for which any kind of adder can be used, except for the one used in the kernel cycles.\\
While for the multiplication introducing this amendment is not a big deal, for division brings some issues, since the operations that must be performed in each step of it depends on the value of the partial reminder at the previous one. The point is that there is no way to know it, when it is expressed in the sum-carry form, without performing a sum of the two parts. This would cancel all the efforts.\\ 
What can be done is to guess the partial reminder looking just at the first 5 bits of sum and carry and then implement some mechanism that corrects the result in case of one or more mistakes done during the elaboration.\\ In few words, performing some approximate computations the divisor architecture is capable to produce at the end an exact result.
\subsection{Multiplication}
Multiplication can be considered much easier to handle then division. As previously said, the carry save adder choice doesn't affect much the design.\\
\subsubsection{Theory explanation}
Architecture is based on the \textit{right shift} algorithm, in which for each step a partial product is computed by multiplying the multiplicand by a bit of the multiplier starting from the rightmost one, then it is summed to a partial result obtain from all the previous steps and finally, the number got, is divided by 2:
\begin{equation}
    p^{(j+1)}=(p^{(j)}+2^k*x_ja)2^{-1}
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{$p^{(j)}$} is the partial result at the generic step \textit{j}.
    \item \textit{$x_j$} is the bit of the multiplier at \textit{j} position starting counting from the lsb.
    \item \textit{k} is the number of bits. In this case 32.
    \item \textit{a} is the multiplicand.
    \item \textit{$p^{(0)}$} is equal to \textbf{0}.
    \item \textit{$p^{(k)}$} is the product of the multiplication.
\end{itemize}
\paragraph{Booth encoding}
Partial products' value may be equal to \textbf{a} if the corresponding multiplier bit is equal to 1 or \textbf{0} in the other case. Performing a multiplication where most control bit are zeros requires less effort than in the opposite possibility. Booth exploited this simple tip re coding multiplier's bit. This operation consists in replacing a sequence of 1s, all additions, with a subtraction at the least-significant end an addition in the position immediately to the left of its most-significant end. As an example
\begin{center}
    \textit{011110} will become \textit{1000-10}
\end{center}
It's possible to obtain from \textit{$x_j$} bit a new \textit{$y_j$} re coded one as follows:
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{c|c|c|c}
        $x_j$   & $x_{j-1}$ & $y_j$ & Explanation   \\
        \hline
        0       &   0        &  0     & No string\\   
        0        &      1     &  1      & End of string              \\
        1        &       0    &   -1    &       Beginning of string  \\
        1        &       1    & 0      &  Continuation of string             \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Booth re coding table}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}
With this re coding we obtain another important feature: now the multiplier can also handle signed operands, while normal right shift one couldn't. In this way is also possible to satisfy 

\subsubsection{Model}
The algorithm for the Booth re coded multiplication can be modeled with the following python code
\begin{minted}[fontsize=\footnotesize]{python}
BE_multiplier (multiplicand,multiplier,signed_unsigned_n,parallelism):
    #converting multiplier in it's equivalent string of bits
    mult_string=printer_2s(multiplier,parallelism)
    a=multiplicand*(2**(parallelism-1)) #a*2^k
    #first case in which there is not x(j-1)
    if (int(mult_string[parallelism-1])): #checking LSB
        p=-a
    else:
        p=0
    p=p/2
    for i in range(0,parallelism-1):
        if mult_string[parallelism-i-2]=='0' and mult_string[parallelism-i-1]=='0':
            p=p
        elif mult_string[parallelism-i-2]=='0' and mult_string[parallelism-i-1]=='1':
            p=p+a
        elif mult_string[parallelism-i-2]=='1' and mult_string[parallelism-i-1]=='0':
            p=p-a
        else:
            p=p
        p=p/2
    p=p*2
    return p
\end{minted}
\subsubsection{DataPath}
For the realization of the multiplier's datapath only simple basic blocks are needed. 
\paragraph{Kernel Logic}
The logic for the selection of the generic partial product is very simple. Two signals are needed:
\begin{itemize}
    \item NonZero: obtained with an XOR gate between $x_j$ and $x_{j-1}$
    \item Negative: obtained with a direct connection with $x_j$
\end{itemize}
It's important to notice that first partial product is directly loaded with the multiplier and it's chosen using its least significant bit.
\paragraph{Final adder}
The final adder is not implemented. Synthesizer will choose a model of adder and place it after synthesis. This will remain true also for the divisor.
\paragraph{Counter}
For reasons of space the counter is omitted in the schematic. A signed multiplication would require only 32 steps, while an unsigned one takes always 33 steps because the case in which $32^{nd}$ bit, most significant bit, is 1 must be taken in account and a 0 must be put at the left end of the number to correctly handle the operation.\\
In order to simplify control and the finite state machine, the machine always performs 33 steps which will always give the right result. A clock cycle is lost for every signed multiplication.\\
Considering that the first step is automatically done while loading the multiplier in the \textit{sumH} register, the counter must count only 32 multiplication steps. Latency is always the same.\\

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[scale=1]{pics/multiplierOutReg.png}
    \caption{Multiplier lower datapath}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
\subsubsection{Finite state machine}
Few controls for the whole multiplication are needed.
\paragraph{\textit{idle} State}
The machine waits in the idle state until a specific signal is raised by the outer world, communicating that operands are valid and need to be evaluated. The only operation performed is a synchronous clear of the sum and carry registers. This is because an asynchronous reset signal controlled by a finite state machine may lead to problems in the post synthesis circuit, since spurious glitches in the output logic of the commands may reset the entire circuit when unwanted.
\paragraph{\textit{save\_multiplicand} State}
Only the multiplicand register is enable, before its negative value must be computed before loading the multiplier.
\paragraph{\textit{save\_multiplier} State}
The multiplexers at the input of the adder in the lower part of the data path must be set correctly in order to compute the \textit{negative multiplicand ($-a$)}. Least significant bit of multiplier will select the correct partial product, that will be loaded with the multiplier in the \textit{sum} registers.
Computing $\textit{-a}$ isn't essential for the purposes of the algorithm. In fact it's possible to add the bit-wise not of the multiplicand to the partial result when required, and store the +1 bit for making the 2's complement in another register. Then at the end, all these +1 bits, in the appropriate weight, can be summed together to the final result, saving one state in the finite state machine.\\
Since for the division is mandatory to compute the negative value of the divisor, the same is done for the multiplication, simplifying a bit the design.\\

    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{pics/multStart_wave.png}
    \caption{Timing of the starting operation}
    \label{fig:my_label}
\end{figure}
Notice that multiplier must remain valid for at least \textbf{three clock cycles} after the rising edge of the \textit{start signal}.
\paragraph{\textit{multKernelStep} State}
After first step is performed, 32 always equal are left. For each one of these the correct partial product must be selected and added to the partial result as explained before. The division by 2 is automatically done storing the output of the carry save adder shifted to the right, the least significant bit of the \textit{sum} goes in the most significant one of the register that initially was holding the multiplier, which is also shifted in order to update control bits for the choice of the next partial product.

\paragraph{\textit{save\_product} State}
Final product will be made up by two words of 32 bits. The most significant one is expressed in the sum-carry form and must be computed by summing the two parts, while the least significant is already ready and stored in the \textit{sumL} register in the range that goes from $33^{rd}$ to the $2^{nd}$ bit.

\subsection{Division}
Very complex and tricky was the design of the divisor. There are three main motivations that contributed to make intricate the realization of a division machine:
\begin{itemize}
    \item available algorithms are not general. Re conducing all possible cases to the specific ones described in literature it's not trivial. What has to be realized is a machine that can handle two operands, signed or unsigned, of 32 bits, but with unknown actual dynamic (e.g. how many bits are sign extension). SRT division is described only for dividend of twice the number of bits respect to the divisor, which must also respect some strict conditions. 
    \item Design, at the beginning, is base on some considerations that may be wrong, but can't be verified at priory. Those assumptions introduce some bug inside a partially working machine that are hard to detect or understand. The only way is to analyze bit by bit the internal behavior, which is a very stress full job, error prone and takes most of the design time.
    \item all number are expressed in fixed point format, but due to different type of operations done in the division kernel, the number of bits assigned for the integer and the fraction may vary across the architecture in order to avoid overflows and unused resources. For example 2.30 format can be extended to 3.30 which is totally different from 2.31, even if they are bot 33 bits data. Or also 2.30 can be truncated to 2.29 if lsb is not needed, but must be handled assigning the right weight to every bit.
    \item some tasks in the algorithm can be \textit{"commutative"}, the order doesn't count for the final result, but can make the design much more complex. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Theory explanation}
Explaining all the theory that lays under the division algorithm is long and complex, this will be a very short recap. For more information please consult the bibliography.\\
\paragraph{Basic algorithm}
The starting point for the model of the final divisor is the \textit{non restoring and signed division}.\\ 
The main procedure lays on the these hypothesis:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dividend can be expressed in \textit{2k} bits while the divisor in half of the width, just \textit{k} bits.
    \item The value obtained by multiplying the divisor by $2^k$ must be strictly less than the dividend. If this condition isn't true an overflow can verify at the first step of the algorithm.
\end{itemize}
 We can generally say that
 \begin{equation}
     z=qd+s
 \end{equation}
 Where \textbf{z} is the dividend, \textbf{q} is the quotient, \textbf{d} is the divisor and \textbf{s} is the reminder.\\
 The operation done in one of the basic steps \textit{j} out of 32 can be then expressed as
 \begin{equation}
     s^{(j)}=2s^{(j-1)}-q_{k-j}*2^kd
 \end{equation}
which is the same as for the restoring algorithm. What changes is that in case the subtraction performed leads to a sign change in the partial reminder, no restore and change of the value of the quotient bit is performed, but in the following step an addition is applied.
The effect of this trick can be easily demonstrate.
\begin{equation}
     s^{(j+1)}=2s^{(j)}+2^kd
 \end{equation}
 Substitution of $s^{(j)}$ leads to:
 \begin{equation}
     s^{(j+1)}=4s^{(j-1)}-2*2^kd+2^kd
 \end{equation}
 The only thing that must be done is to keep track of what operation has been performed for each step in the quotient.\\
 If $sign(s^j)=sign(d)$, $q_{k-j}$ is set to \textit{1}. In the opposite case it is set to \textit{-1}. \\
 At the end, it's possible to obtain two numbers, the one made of \textit{1} and the other made of \textit{-1}. To get the quotient is enough subtracting the twos.\\
 Before producing the result is mandatory to check if the reminder is coherent with the dividend, if it's not a correction step must be provided to recover the mistake. If sign($s^k$)=sign(d) it means that d must be subtracted to $s^k$ and quotient incremented, if it's not 
an addition is needed and quotient is decremented.\\
\paragraph{SRT division}
The \textit{Sweeney-Robertson-Tocher division} is based on the idea that it's possible to avoid any addition or subtraction in a normal kernel step if the partial reminder is enough "small". If it is in the range $[-d,d)$, multiplying it by two, it's possible to choose $q_{k-j}$ equal to 0.\\
%%mettere le immagini delle soglie, prese dal libro
The problem of this concept is that is not possible to compare the partial reminder with the divisor without subtracting them and then analyze the result with extra logic. This would slow down dramatically the architecture.\\ The only way to undo the knot is to choose easy fixed thresholds for the comparison, it's possible to achieve this by expressing the operands in fixed point 1.31. Then two conditions must hold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $d \geq 0.5$, if it's not true divisor must be shifted left. The number of shifts will become the number of kernel step that must be performed. It's important to remember that the reminder must be corrected at the end by shifting it right the same amount of time.
    \item $-d \leq z < d$, if it's not true dividend must be shifted right once, then result must also be realigned at the end. In the design z is always divided by 2, so that this condition is always true.
\end{itemize}
Two comparison are still needed to select the correct quotient digit, but now they can be done with two constants: $-0.5$ and $0.5$. This implies just a logic gate layer.\\

\paragraph{Carry Save adder}
Carry save adder, as for the multiplication, speeds up the computation done each cycle.\\
But imagine if partial reminders must be stored in the sum-carry form. The only way to determine it's actual is to compute it. This would null all the advantages obtained introducing the carry save adder. What can be done is to sum just the most significant bits up to second decimal place and modify thresholds to handle the case in which the actual number falls outside the range with an approximate computation. The sum can be implemented with a look-up table or a PLA in order to in crease the access speed.\\
In literature, it's written that only two guard bits are needed to avoid overflows after the sum, but what was found during the design is that there are cases, one over two thousand, in which one more is needed for the carry register. So in the schematic 5 bits are used for the quotient bit selection.

\subsubsection{Model}
All the steps described in the previous part are resumed in the following python code, which is as close as possible to what the hardware machine really do.

\end{minted}
\subsubsection{Datapath}
In the schematic proposed for each wire is indicated the parallelism and where significant also the fixed format digits.
As for the multiplier all the blocks are very simple ones. Only the kernel logic require some attention.
\paragraph{Kernel Logic}
The kernel logic consist in block that given 5 most significant bit of the sum and the 5 of the carry produces an exact sum. As already said, this can be implemented with a 10 bit entry look-up table or PLA.
Depending on the output of the first stage \textit{SignSel} and \textit{Non0} signals are driven, and they will determine next quotient bit.

        $[-0.5,0)$    &      -     &  0      & 0              \\
        $[0,+\infty )$        &       0    &   1    &      $d*sign(d)$  \\
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Division kernel logic output table}
    \label{tab:my_label}
\end{table}
\paragraph{Reminder shift register}
The reminder shift register is actually made of 34 bits, because it's already loaded divided by two, if the machine shifts it as many time as the divisor was shifted, it will result wrong. The solution was found in saving it with a 0 in the least significant bit so that taking first 32 bits of the register there won't be any mistakes.

\subsubsection{Finite State Machine}
Here is done a fast description of what is done in each state of the FSM. For what concerns the \textit{idle} state and the start timing please check the multiplier section.
\paragraph{\textit{idle} State}
The machine waits for a rising edge on the start signal.
\paragraph{\textit{loadData} State}
Operands are loaded into the appropriate registers multiplied by 2. Divisor is checked on the fly to understand if it needs left shifts. In case it's ready, \textit{1} is loaded in the counter, since we need to perform just one step. This never verifies in case of signed division because $33^{rd}$ bit will always be a sign extension. 
\paragraph{\textit{divisorLShift} State}
Divisor is shifted and then a change of trend is checked by xoring $32^{nd}$ and $31^{st}$, since the shift will be updated in the successive cycle. The counter is enabled for counting how many kernel step must be performed, starting from 1 because divisor was loaded multiplied by 2.
\paragraph{\textit{saveIterloop} State}
Once the divisor is properly aligned it's important to keep track of how many multiplications by 2 have been done. Counter output is stored inside a dedicated feedback-register, the value will be read at the end few state later.
\paragraph{\textit{divKernelStep} State}
The main operation consists of a sum between the number produced by the proper logic and the previous partial reminder, expressed in sum-carry form. The result is automatically multiplied by two and feeds the registers in upper data path.\\
The two registers dedicated to the quotient also sample the new bit.
%puÃ² essere usato da due processori o due operazioni contemporaneamente contemporaneamente!
\paragraph{\textit{computeQ} State}
From now on only the two output adder are going to be used. Firstly they are set to compute a early version of the quotient and the reminder, the results will be then stored in the output registers used as accumulators. In this state the counter is re loaded with the previously store numeber of total shifts.
\paragraph{\textit{waitSignals} State}
Since the logic for the new state selection is driven from the output of the output, a clock cycle must be lost to let the signals propagate across the circuit. 
\paragraph{\textit{qInv} State}
Before going ahead, the sign of the quotient must be corrected. If the divisor is negative we must switch the sign performing the 2's complement of it's value.
\paragraph{\textit{correctDown} and \textit{correctUp} State}
These two states correct the results when needed.
\paragraph{\textit{RemCorrectio} State}
Lastly it's needed to shift right the reminder for a number of time that was stored in the counter in the \textit{computeQ} state. It must be noticed that the reminder is loaded already divided by 2 so, one step less is needed. For this purpose the shift register is made of 34 bits so that the actual least significant bit is not drop during last step.
\paragraph{\textit{divDone} State}
End of computation is signaled to the outer world.

\subsection{Complete multiplication and division unit}
After the study of the single multiplication and division, it was not difficult to integrate everything in a single architecture.\\
Main difference is represented by a conditions checking circuit in which the following special case are tested:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Two consecutive instructions require the same computation, which is avoided and the result is directly given at the output.
    \item In case of division, divisor value is 0.
    \item In case of signed division, divisor value is -1 and dividend one is $-2^{k-1}$, so that the resulting quotient will overflow the capability of 32 bits.
\end{itemize}
